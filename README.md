# VerusBench: Hand-Written Examples of Verified Verus Code

This is intended to be a collection of examples translated from the [HumanEval]
benchmark into Rust.  The goal is that each example will include a textual
prompt, a [Verus] specification that mathematically captures the prompt, Rust
code implementing the example, and any proof annotations needed for [Verus] to
verify that the code is correct.  We plan to use the repository to evaluate
how well AI techniques can produce Verus proofs.  It will also serve as a useful
collection of examples for people just learning Verus.

See the [task list](https://github.com/secure-foundations/human-eval-verus/wiki/Task-List)
for which tasks have been completed and which still need work.  If you'd like
to work on a task, **please put your name next to it** on the list, so we can
avoid duplicated effort.  To help get you started, in the [gpt
folder](./tasks/gpt), we have (unverified) Rust code generated by ChatGPT.  Of
course, the code may be completely incorrect, so feel free to ignore it and
start your code from scratch.

Contributors will be acknowledged in any publications that may be published
about this benchmark.
