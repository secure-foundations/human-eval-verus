# HumanEval-Verus: Hand-Written Examples of Verified Verus Code Derived From HumanEval

This is intended to be a collection of examples translated from the [HumanEval]
benchmark into Rust.  The goal is that each example will include a textual
prompt, a [Verus] specification that mathematically captures the prompt, Rust
code implementing the example, and any proof annotations needed for [Verus] to
verify that the code is correct.  We plan to use the repository to evaluate
how well AI techniques can produce Verus proofs.  It will also serve as a useful
collection of examples for people just learning Verus.

See the [task list](https://github.com/secure-foundations/human-eval-verus/wiki/Task-List)
for which tasks have been completed and which still need work.  If you'd like
to work on a task, **please put your name next to it** on the list, so we can
avoid duplicated effort.  To help get you started, in the [gpt
folder](./tasks/gpt), we have (unverified) Rust code generated by ChatGPT.  Of
course, the code may be completely incorrect, so feel free to ignore it and
start your code from scratch.
