/// In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
/// and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
/// between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
/// There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
/// If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
/// all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
/// Otherwise, return "NO".
/// For example:
/// exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
/// exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
/// It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
