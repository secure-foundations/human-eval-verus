/// Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
/// each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
/// inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.
///
/// You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
/// from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
/// in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
/// cell.
/// Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
/// necessarily distinct).
/// You CANNOT go off the grid.
/// A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
/// after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
/// through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
/// than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
/// such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
/// lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
/// It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
/// Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.
///
/// Examples:
///
///     Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
///     Output: [1, 2, 1]
///
///     Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
///     Output: [1]
