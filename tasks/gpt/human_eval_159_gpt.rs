/// You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,

/// you should return a tuple of (total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
/// the number of carrots left after your meals)
/// if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
///
/// Example:
/// * eat(5, 6, 10) -> (11, 4)
/// * eat(4, 8, 9) -> (12, 1)
/// * eat(1, 10, 10) -> (11, 0)

///
/// Variables:
/// @number: u32
///     the number of carrots that you have eaten.
/// @need: u32
///     the number of carrots that you need to eat.
/// @remaining: u32
///     the number of remaining carrots that exist in stock

/// Constraint:
/// * 0 <= number <= 1000
/// * 0 <= need <= 1000
