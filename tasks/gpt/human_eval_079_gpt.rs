/// You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to

/// There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
/// The extra characters are there to help with the format.

/// decimal_to_binary(15)   // returns "db1111db"
/// decimal_to_binary(32)   // returns "db100000db"
