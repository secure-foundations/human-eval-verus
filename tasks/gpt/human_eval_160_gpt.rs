/// Given two vectors `operator` and `operand`, the first vector has basic algebra operations as strings,
/// and the second vector is a vector of integers. Use the two given vectors to build the algebraic
/// expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
///
/// The basic algebra operations:
/// Addition ( + )
/// Subtraction ( - )
/// Multiplication ( * )
/// Floor division ( // ) - Note: Rust uses `/` for division and does not have a direct equivalent to Python's `//`.
/// Exponentiation ( ** ) - Note: Rust uses `pow` method for exponentiation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let operators = vec!['+', '*', '-'];
/// let operands = vec![2, 3, 4, 5];
/// let result = do_algebra(operators, operands);
/// assert_eq!(result, 9);
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - The length of `operator` vector is equal to the length of `operand` vector minus one.
/// - `operand` is a vector of non-negative integers.
/// - `operator` vector has at least one operator, and `operand` vector has at least two operands.
