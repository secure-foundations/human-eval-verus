/// You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
/// and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
/// Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
/// and all buckets have the same capacity.
/// Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
/// Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
///
/// Example 1:
///     Input: 
///         grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
///         bucket_capacity : 1
///     Output: 6
///
/// Example 2:
///     Input: 
///         grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
///         bucket_capacity : 2
///     Output: 5
///
/// Example 3:
///     Input: 
///         grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
///         bucket_capacity : 5
///     Output: 0
///
/// Constraints:
///     * all wells have the same length
///     * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
///     * 1 <= grid[0].length <= 10^2
///     * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
///     * 1 <= capacity <= 10
